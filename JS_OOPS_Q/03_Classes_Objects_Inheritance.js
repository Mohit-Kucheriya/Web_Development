Create a class Vehicle with properties make and model, and a method getDetails() that returns a string "Make: [make], Model: [model]". Create a subclass Car that extends Vehicle and adds a method startEngine() that returns "Engine started".

/*
Task 2: Method Overriding in Inheritance

Extend the Vehicle class from the previous task to include a method move() that returns "The vehicle is moving". Then, override the move() method in the Car class to return "The car is driving".
*/

/*
Task 3: Static Methods in Classes

Add a static method isVehicle(obj) to the Vehicle class that checks if a given object is an instance of Vehicle. The method should return true if the object is a Vehicle or a subclass of Vehicle, and false otherwise.
